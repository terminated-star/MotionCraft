# MotionCraft

Bhopping, as a server-side Minecraft plugin/mod.  
Currently, not production-ready.  

## Goals

- Be compatible with versions from 1.8.8 to the latest.
- Be compatible with the oldest LTS version of java [with support](https://endoflife.date/java/).
- Be compatible with multiple APIs. (Spigot, Minestom, and maybe Sponge, Fabric, and Forge.)
- Be decently performant.

MotionCraft will always be free and open source.

## Current State

Currently, only available on servers that implement the Paper API.
