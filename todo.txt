give them night vision
give them levitation

add an option where if they stop moving for x ticks it will reset them to the start of the map

Use kyori for things like messages

Make things like the user's speed thread-safe, since it can be accessed async

don't have a built-in score board, (or at least have it optional), they should use placeholders with an existing scoreboard plugin instead

create a guide for each anti-cheat on which checks to disable to get it to stop false flagging.
see how well matrix free version works

add support for jump detection on spigot:
Uses velocity: https://bukkit.org/threads/detect-player-jump.445415/
Uses statistics: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/accurate-playerjumpevent-do-actions-when-players-jump.138946/
Possibly a better statistic way, uses onPlayerStatisticIncrement: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/playerjumpevent.334128/
Another way with velocity: https://medium.com/@enjikaka/detecting-a-jump-on-minecraft-server-with-bukkit-or-spigot-817ac106142f
add all of these as jump algorithms

We can create this event inside the core, as it is not api specific (minus paper's jump event)

Detect paper: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/how-do-i-detect-if-a-server-is-running-paper.499064/

config example:

jump-detection-mode = "AUTO" or "MANUAL" or "PAPER"
jump-detection-manual-mode = "AUTO" or "VELOCITY" or "STATISTICS"

make an option where players who are not x blocks from spawn are not visible

don't use ticks for things like safe ground ticks, use time instead

using the paper api requires us to use a newer java version...

make this plugin thread safe (speed, ticks on ground, etc.)

add support for craft bukkit, the spigot api should override the bukkit api

see what ticks on ground, etc. is every tick, it seems bugged
