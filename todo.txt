maybe we should tick things like speed in the actual user class so the variables would be easier
the above would make doing thr async math and then the sync applying the velocity more difficult

make an event manager

give them night vision
give them levitation

2 events for tick, one for sync and one for async

when calling stuff on spigot, make sure we are on the main thread (with Bukkit.isPrimaryThread() ), if not then do runTask or callSyncMethod

maybe we shouldn't use async on spigot as it waits until the next tick for starting a new task
we could always just make the async tick event not actually be async if it turns out to be bad

we should have our own "scheduler" that calls the bukkit scheduler, otherwise in bukkit if we called two events in a row, it would run two tasks

add an option where if they stop moving for x ticks it will reset them

Use kyori for things like messages
